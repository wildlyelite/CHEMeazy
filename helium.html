			<h1> HELIUM </h1>

			<div id="description">
				A CHEMICAL ELEMENT WHICH COMES AFTER HYDROGEN AND BEFORE LITHIUM HAVING ATOMIC NUMBER 2 IN THE PERIODIC
			TABLE AND HAVING THE HOUSE ADDRESS OF 1PERIOD,18/8A GROUP&
			FIRST ELITE MEMBER OF THE NOBLE FAMILY.
			</div>
			 <div id="physical-properties">
				PHYSICAL PROPERTIES:
				HELIUM IS ONE OF THE LIGHTEST ELEMENTS AND HAS VERY LOW BOILING AND MELTING POINT, WHICH IS A COLOURLESS GAS
				WITH NO ODOUR, NO TASTE AND IT'S NON-TOXIC WITH THE ADDITION OF INERTNESS AND IS A MONOATOMIC GAS
				
			 </div>
			 <div id="atomic-properties">
				<h1>ATOMIC PROPERTIES:</h1>
				THE ATOMIC PROPERTIES OF HELIUM ARE AS FOLLOWS:
				1. Atomic number:2
				2.Atomic mass:4.00260 g.mol -1
				3. Electronegativity according to Pauling(electronegativity scale): Not Available
				4.Density:0.178*10 -3 g.cm -3 at 20 Â°C
				5.Melting point:- 272.2 (26 atm) Â°C(545.35 Kelvin(K))
				6.Boiling point:- 268.9 Â°C(4.25Kelvin(K))
				7.Vanderwaals radius :140pm(0.118 nm)
				8 .Ionic radius: Not Available (AS it is inert, so no charge no ionic radiusðŸ˜Š)
				9. Isotopes: 3He and 4He ARE ONLY STABLE OUT OF 9(UPDATED On 17/1/22)
				10. Electronic shell: 1S2
				The energy of first ionisation:2372 kJ.mol-1
				Although there are nine known isotopes of helium (2He) (standard atomic weight: 4.002602(2)),
				only helium-3 (He) and helium-4 (4He) are stable. All radioisotopes are short-lived, the longest-lived being
				6He with a half-life of 806.92(24) milliseconds. The least stable is 10
				He, with a half-life of 260(40) yoctoseconds (2.6(4)Ã—10âˆ’22 s), although it is possible that 2
				He may have an even shorter half-life.

			 <div id="isotopes">
				ISOTOPES:
				The Same molecular formula but a different element in properties. As We read that â€˜Heâ€™ has a total of 9
				isotopes acc. to the latest resources but there are only two which are stable th ey are:
				1.HELIUM-3(3He)- a stable isotope of helium with two protons and one neutron.
				2.HELIUM-4(4He)-a stable isotope of the helium nucleus is identical to an alpha particle and consists of two
				protons and two neutrons.
				Though All radioisotopes are short-lived, the longest-lived being, He with a HALF-LIFE OF just 806.92(24)
				milliseconds can you believe it. The least stable is 10He, with a half-life of 260(40) yoctoseconds
				(2.6(4)Ã—10âˆ’22 s), although 2He may have an even shorter half-life.

				FUN FACTS ABOUT THE HELIUM:
				IT'S SECOND MOST ABUNDANT ELEMENT IN THE UNIVERSE AND THE SECOND LIGHTEST ELEMENT though contributing only
				0.000524% in the earth which is very rare
				Helium got its name from the Greek god â€˜Heliosâ€™ which means sun and the sun produces 700million tonnes of He
				per second.
				THE USE OF IT IS GENERALLY BALLONS, WELDING, ETCâ€¦REMARKABLE USED WAS WHEN He WAS USED TO FLEW THE FAMOUS
				'AIRLANDER'AIRCRAFT.
	
				a)Year of Discovery of Element: It was on August 18, 1868, that the first evidence of helium was observed by
				French astronomer Pierre Janssen.
				b)Scientist Who Discovered The Element: Discovered by
				Sir Ramsey in 1895
				c)How Did The Scientist Discover The Element: the first observance was made by Pierre Janssen during a total
				solar eclipse and that too in Guntur, INDIA. On October 20 of the same year, Norman Lockyer also observed a
				yellow line in the solar spectrum, concluding that it was caused by an element in the sun then unknown on
				earth, with English chemist naming it as â€˜Heliosâ€™ means the SUN GOD. Janssen is jointly credited with the
				discovery of the element with the Norman Lockyer.
