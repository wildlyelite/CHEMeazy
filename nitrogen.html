  <h2>Nitrogen is the seventh element in the modern periodic table. Its atomic number is '7' and its atomic mass is '14'. The nitrogen atom has seven electrons in its valence shell. In its nucleus, it has seven proton and seven neutrons.
    The electronic configuration of nitrogen is '1s2 2s2 2p5'. The nitrogen atom forms a covalent bond with another nitrogen atom to become stable.
    Nitrogen is a non-metal , thus it gains electrons. Nitrogen ion is denoted by 'N3-'. The three nitrogen atoms form one nitrogen molecule 'N3'. The nitrogen atom was first discovered by a Scottish scientist Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Hydrogen was
    named
    by the scientist Jean-Antoine Chaptal in 1790.
