    <h2>Oxygen is the eighth element in the modern periodic table. Its atomic number is '8' and its atomic mass is '16'. Oxygen has a total of 8 electrons in its valence shell. Oxygen has 8 protons and 8 neutrons in its nucleus.
        The electronic configuration of oxygen is '1s2 2s2 2p6'. Two oxygen atoms form a covalent bond with eachother to form an oxygen molecule. It is denoted by 'O2'. Oxygen is a non-metal , thus it gains electrons and becomes oxygen ion which is denoted by 'O2-'. Oxygen was first discovered by Joseph Priestley in 1774. Oxygen plays a very important role in the survival of human beigns and other animals as they breathe in oxygen gas and exhale carbon dioxide gas 'CO2'.
        Basically oxygen is responsible for combustion. Earth's atmosphere is filled with 21% of oxygen. Three oxygen atoms combine to form the ozone moleule 'O3'. The ozone layer protects he earth from the harmful radiation of UV rays of the sun. </h2>
